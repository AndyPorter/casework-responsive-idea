# casework-responsive-idea
exploring responsive design template for caseworking system

exploration of how we might make a repsonsive layout for casework system. Using the gov kit as a basis to explore ideas, so we don't have to reinvent all the structure from scratch.

## Aims

to explore how to make something responsive for caseworkers and their kit,
to help conversation woth front end developers (and outher disciplines) about how to make something repsonsive, that meets caseworker and environment needs.

## Assumption

Starting with the govkit as a basis to document/show - will be simpler than making something from scratch - that we can easily leverage the template, grid, size breakpoints - the responsiveness.
