# casework-responsive-idea
exploring responsive design template for caseworking system

exploration of how we might make a repsonsive layout for casework system. Using the gov kit as a basis to explore ideas, so we don't have to reinvent all the structure from scratch.

## Aims

to explore how to make something responsive for caseworkers and their kit,
to help conversation with the design practice, front end developers (and other disciplines - e.g product and test) about how to make something repsonsive, that meets caseworker, kit, and working practice needs.

## Assumption

Starting with the govkit as a basis to document/show will be simpler than making something entirely from scratch - that we can easily leverage the template, grid, size breakpoints - the responsiveness.

Making a browser based protoype is better than paper, sketches or other non responsive format - make a proto in the material that will be used.
